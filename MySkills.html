                <h3> My First Website Project</h3>
                <p>This is my first ever project made using html and css. I created this way back I was senior high school in STI College Dasmarinas. This is a simple blog site with no contents other than lorem ipsum. The buttons aren't working yet because it was a simple first semester project in my senior high days. </p>

                    <p>This project is an like an ATM. It allows user to deposit, withdraw, check balance, pay bills, and change pin. It also has a login register feature where it is saved in the database. I used SQL for the database. The informations and "money" that is saved in the user's account is automatically saved in the database. I created this project during my First year College second semester in Cavite State University as a Semester Project.</p>

                        <h3>My Third Project</h3>
                        <p>This project is a simple yet helpful in someway. It features a money converter wherein you can input the amount of money in PHP (Philippine Peso) and convert it approximately to almost all available currency. The only downside of it is that it doesn't have real time data of the conversion rate. It's only an approximate money converter.</p>

                    <h3>My Fourth Project</h3>
                    <p>This project is a simple yet useful application. It is a payroll system that also has database in it. I used SQL for it too and it also reflects to what the user does in the application. <br> <br> <br> In this project, there is the admin where the admin can add, remove, or edit employee currently listed in their database. As per their employees, whenever they logged in their account, personal informations and days worked plus the possible salary so far. Also, the administrator can also see the list of employees (refer to the picture below.)</p>
